# RentMe

## Details

RentMe is an application that lists available rental units from various real estate businesses such as Kijiji, Killam, and Capreit. We've arrived as a solution to assist people in finding the best offer in the market. This gives customers a unique perspective on the housing market as a whole since we make it easy for them to interact with respective landlords. In this applications, there are three key actors: the user, the administrator, and the landlord. Users will be able to search for the best bargain.The landlord will be able to use RentMe to advertise a rental unit. RentMe will facilitate the connection between the user and the landlord. The administrator will manage both the user and the landlord.
